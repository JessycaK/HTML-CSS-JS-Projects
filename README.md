# HTML-CSS-JS-Projects

I'm currently learning Web Development fundamentals and I thought, the best way to hone my skills is to build basic projects following tutorial online.
These projects are giving me the skills to build simple websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along the way, I am also learning how to use VScode, Git and Github.

Every project is started from scratch and finished without using copied code.

To fast track my learning process, I am taking avantage of every free resources out there, such as, Youtube, FreeCodeCamp, Frontend Mentor etc...
